# greenhouse
This is the incipit of a project of a Greenhouse management and control software.
In the GreenhosueJava you can find the management part of the software. It interacts with an MQTT broker, in our case Mosquitto.
In the GreenhouseArduino you can find the part of the software deployed on a arduino mega for the controller purpose. 
The controller part needs a temperature sensor (DHT11 in our case), an irradiance analogic sensor, and a moisture analogic sensor.
